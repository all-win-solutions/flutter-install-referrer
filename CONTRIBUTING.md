## Style

The Plugin follow Google style—or Flutter style for Dart—for the languages they use, and use auto-formatters:

- [Dart](https://dart.dev/docs) formatted
  with `dart format`
- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide) formatted with
  [`ktfmt`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ktfmt)
- [Swift](https://google.github.io/swift/) formatted with [`swift-format`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/swift-format)

## Issue a Pull Request

- Please **update the package version** in `pubspec.yaml` and `CHANGELOG.md`. We use [semantic versionining (SemVer)](https://semver.org/). TL;DR: increase the patch version when your pull request contains a bug fix. Increase the minor version when a new feature is added. Breaking changes to _Flutter Install Referrer_'s public API should result in an increase in the major version.

- Please **update the changelog** in `CHANGELOG.md`. Add a new level two heading with the updated package version to the top of the document, e.g. `## major.minor.patch`. The changelog will be shown on https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_install_referrer/changelog.
